Just playing around with the Habitica Todolist App API. Pulls, caches and lists user data. 

Need to have process.env.HabitToken and process.env.HabitUser available in order to run with your Habitica account. 

See https://habitica.com/static/api for more information.

```bash
	npm install
	npm test
	npm start
```
